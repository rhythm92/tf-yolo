# TF-YOLO

This a Tensorflow implementation of YOLO, a convolutional neural network based real time object detection algorithm. The original algorithm is proposed in http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640 and implemented in Darknet: http://pjreddie.com/darknet/.

This is an ongoing project that re-implements YOLO in tensorflow. It's going to support training, evaluation and inference.
